My name is James Abdy, and I am interested in starting/abandoning random software projects. I obtained my Master's degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Machine Learning at the end of 2017 from the Georgia Institute of Technology. I work as a Lead Software Engineer at Cox Automotive with a focus on building flutter apps to support internal operations. I was raised outside of Atlanta, Georgia, but I currently live in Montreal. I like watching HBO shows, traveling, and skiing poorly.

I am working on some personal projects that I hope to have up on the site shortly.
