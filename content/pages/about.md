My name is James Abdy, and I am interested in starting/abandoning random software projects. I am a Full Stack Developer at Cox Automotive, primarily focused on preventing fraud and supporting internal operations. I obtained my Master’s degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Machine Learning from the Georgia Institute of Technology in late 2017. I was raised outside of Atlanta, but now live in Oakland. I enjoy watching HBO shows, traveling, and skiing poorly.

I am working on some personal projects that I hope to have up on the site shortly. Like everyone else, AI does all my work now.
